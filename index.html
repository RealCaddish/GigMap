          As a music lover living in Lexington, I was constantly checking multiple sources to find out 
          what shows were happening around town. I wanted a single, visual way to see all the live music 
          events happening in Lexington at a glance. That's why I created this map - to make it easier 
          to find shows and avoid missing out on the good stuff happening around the city.

        <h3>How It Works</h3>
        <p>
          The Lexington Gig Map automatically scrapes live music event data from Songkick and displays 
          each show as a point on an interactive map of the city. The map makes it easy to see where 
          shows are happening geographically and when they're scheduled.
        </p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Interactive Map:</strong> Each point on the map represents a venue hosting one or 
            more shows. Click or tap on any point to see details about the events at that venue, including 
            artist names, dates, times, and venue information. If multiple shows are scheduled at the same 
            venue, you'll see them all in a scrollable list.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Calendar Legend:</strong> At the bottom of the map, you'll find a calendar showing 
            all upcoming shows organized by date. Each day displays the artist names and venues, making 
            it easy to browse by date. Hover over any event card to see a preview tooltip with more details.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Color Coding:</strong> Events are automatically color-coded by proximity to help you 
            quickly identify shows happening soon:
            <ul style="margin-top: 8px; padding-left: 20px;">
              <li><span style="color: hsl(0, 75%, 50%);">●</span> Red/Orange = Tonight/Tomorrow</li>
              <li><span style="color: hsl(45, 75%, 55%);">●</span> Yellow/Orange = This Week</li>
              <li><span style="color: hsl(150, 70%, 50%);">●</span> Green = Next Week</li>
              <li><span style="color: hsl(220, 70%, 50%);">●</span> Blue = Later</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Venue Information:</strong> When you click on a map marker, you'll see detailed 
            information about the shows including artist images (when available), venue details, and 
            links to purchase tickets. The map can also zoom directly to any venue location.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Data Updates:</strong> The map is updated regularly with the latest show information 
            from Songkick, so you always have access to current event listings.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      
      <p>
